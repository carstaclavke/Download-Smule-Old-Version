# Download Smule Old Version
  
Yes Folks, Smule has added the Delete Account function to the Android version too. Interesting they bothered to do this on the Android version. Reason I say this as since the "so called" software developers changed the sound engine and added the skip forward and backward function to Smule it doesn't work for me (The app in general I mean). First it was out of sync (Have not seen that since my Galaxy S6 days). Then recently since then the app doesn't record my voice at all!
 
My VIP runs out next week and I will not be spending a penny on VIP or gifts either forever or until at least it works on my Android phone again. (Having to resort to an Iphone just to catch up with friends).

"so-called" software developers is a good term for them. This is Smule's new team, which messed up the main profile as well as other views with their cr@ppy changes, most of which don't work. They've added a Playlist feature but when you go into the playlist, you have no idea who the co-singers are on the collabs. In the process they've also messed up Favorites, now a playlist, which was much more readable before. All you can see is song names along with huge thumbnails! Then there's the joins screen, when you play a join, the whole joins screen disappears after the song is played, making you have to find it again and figure out where you were before it disappeared. What kind of software team writes this kind of broken code, especially to replace code that used to work beautifully? And yeah they will not listen to feedback, no matter how many paying subscribers send it to them.
 
Their profile menu is a total mishap. Apart from taking away the Favorites and putting it into the playlist menu, moved Bookmarks, Songs, Groups and Gifts into an About menu which nobody ever opens! By definition a bookmark is something that is easily accessible. These people have redefined the term to mean the exact opposite!?
 
Those who've updated the app recently will encounter to their pleasant surprise a much-improved pin feature on Smule, with a bigger pic (like it was before they changed it) and 3 pins instead of just 1! A rare useful update ??

On the older version of the app (which is installed on an older device I have which still lets me join expired invites), the pin shows up like it did about a year back before they made all the unnecessary changes.. nice and big, dominating the upper part of the screen. But the other 2 pins don't show up like they do with the latest update, which allows you to scroll the pins up top. Probably not worth updating for just this! Old is gold when it comes to smule app versions ?
 
I understand that feeling. I too have gone through that phase. But then I realized over a period of time that we should not judge ourselves by what others do in Smule, especially when I saw bad singers getting dozens of joins and some really good singers barely recognized.
 
I think generally it is a case of "Just being nice". If they really think that I am good I would get at least 5 - 10 % return joins which has never been the case as far as I am concerned. But if you look at the compliments I receive it would seem they think the world of my singing abilities. It's a fake transactional world out there. So nowadays I don't care whether someone joins my OC or not and I take all the nice compliments with several pinches of salt. I know that I am not an exceptional singer but not too bad either. So at times, I still wonder what is the USP that enables below-average singers to get more joins and pins. Strangely they get joins from really good singers too. Maybe they are real-life friends or there are some other reasons I don't know. There is no point in wasting my time thinking about all these things.  
So if I like to sing a song with a good singer I just join. I don't expect anything in return.  
If I want to give/get genuine feedback Smule is not the place. But it would be good to have an app where everyone is judged on their merits and genuine feedback is given and received in a positive spirit.  
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any such alternative app.  
Smule's closest competitor Starmaker is much worse.
 
Yay! Thanks for getting it. I do have to admit to being a hypocrite, because I have one friend who always pins my recordings, so I always pin hers when I have VIP. People probably think the same things about me as I do about them ?
 
While we're on the amazingly rare topic of praising smule rather than damning it/them, I do like the new Alchemist setting - 8 levels of EQ etc to fiddle with; it's almost TOO much choice. I feel like Phil Spector now. As in tech wizard, not actress-killer.
 
Hi everyone. Was wondering if there is a way that we can join an expired collab? I think I read something about that on here that you can. I was just wondering if someone can explain step by step how we can do this. Thanks everyone
 
When i started singing in Smule had more joins (and I sang very bad, haha). Nowadays I see a lot of persons open and open OCs but no join to others. At the end the people joins only the persons that have joined to them and it creates a vicious circle of lot of OC with only a few (or even zero) joins what makes the decision of Smule very good.
 
Just last night, I received a Notification that one of my invites has expired and received so many joins and to thank them all. (Personally I hate this generic Tank you all but I suppose it works for people with 100's of Joins as it is time Consuming to tank all joiners individually)
 
yeah especially if you put the join song in your favorites then it works to join anytime, i think is a good idea so we don't have to do it all over again or find someone else to sing the same song again. Its too complicated
 
That's always so disheartening. I hate when I have a really great recording and I watch it die on the vine with one or two joins. If the search system didn't only offer "most popular" and "expiring soon" more people would find them.
 
That is a really good question! It seems I usually learn about new features and how to use them from Sing Salon or singing friends on Smule. I sometimes delete and reinstall the app, and I did get a pop up upon signing in to inform me of this change. But otherwise, Smule is relying on word of mouth. For long time smule users, it may be worth the effort of adjusting to the ever-changing Smule experience. But for new and casual users, I think Smule could do a better job communicating how to use the app.
 
Unfortunately people we follow may be oblivious to us and may not know us. I follow max 100 members and keep pruning it down. If each member I follow sends one invite a night. In a week there will be 700 invites. One has to be lucky to find time to record 5 duets a night. I might book mark 70 out of 700 and sing about 25 or 50 max a week.
 
I am glad Smule now has a feature that allows us to invite 25 members we follow at a time. We could not do that before. So invites only went to followers mostly. Today I am able to send my invites to all 100 I follow and am happy if one or two friends find the time to join
 
As for followers joining ones invites. It is a nightmare for all popular female singers. One Lady was consistently getting 250 to 300 joins for each and every invite of hers as she has about 9000 followers and she is a Professional Doctor and totally stressed out as a front line worker during Covid in the US. Her way to de-stress was to come home and sing away. On one Occassion there was a man abusing her for not commenting on his join. He said if you do not have the decency to comment then do not send invites. I stepped in and told him to get lost or he will be banned. This is a huge problem in India with men trying to bully and demanding female members join their invites etc. Very Complex Issue with no easy solutions and even if we have solutions Smule cannot be bothered.
 
Say I have 500 followers. I don' t want to invite all the followers as many of then are worse than donkeys when it comes to singing. "I would like an option of handpicking my fav followers and invite just them."
 
And God I go to bed after midnight every night and when I wake up in the morning there are a few hundred notifications. I am not interested is some dude hitting a like button. I am not interested in a 100 Thank you for Joining generic Notifications for every song I joined. In this deluge of notifications most of us often miss very important joins upsetting family and friends who assume you are ignoring them. This happened to one of my nieces and she refuses to join any of my invites as she believes I purposely ignored her Join. She will not accept the fact that I am not looking at Smule notifications 24/7
